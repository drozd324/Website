        Some good programming tutorials in python to simulate some <a href="https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/tutorials/pygame-physics-simulation/">basic physics.</a>

            <a href  ="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3schools</a> This website is the best way, in my opinion, to learn any
            bit of basics for any programming language that I have attemped to learn. Lots of examples and take as much time as you 
            want, unlike in a youtube video.

            A really good "book" on <a href="http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html">Machine learning</a> by Michael Nielsen.
            Its a nice read with very good explenations of the core concepts of Machine learning and neural networks.
