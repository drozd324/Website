                For the summer of 2024 I was awarded a <a href="https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-professional/">DAAD RISE Professional</a> scholarship which involved
                completing an intership at <a href="https://www.iwes.fraunhofer.de/">Fraunhofer IWES</a> on the campus of 
                <a href="https://uol.de/en">Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg</a>. Fraunhofer IWES (Institute For Windenergy Systems) is an applied research
                institute which is concerned with developing, modelling and improving wind turbine systems. During my time there I worked on analysing data (mainly wind data) 
                gathered by MET (Meteorogical) masts and running CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulations solving RANS equations over a particular 
                terrain which I was given terrain data for.

                Below is a relatively heavily censored versions of images in a presentain I gave. The idea of putting this here is for you, the reader, to maybe get some 
                impression of the types of things I was looking at and thinking about. I got covered up he axes numbers and some images as there is some data confidentiality
                in my work which I do not want to encroach on.
