		Barren wasteland here for now. I put this up here to hopefully motivate me to write some cool quatum algorith with quiskit
		or something like that at some point. There is a really cool website <a href="https://quantumalgorithmzoo.org/">QuantumAlgorithmZoo</a> which 
		has some cool, well they are more weird if anyting, quantum algorithms on showcase in the form of some links and a paragraph or two.
		One that has stuck in my head for some reason is one on calculating knot invariants which is had some really interesiing and quite 
		involved maths behind it, I cant imagine it would be applicable to anything off the top of my head but knot theory is quite fun.
