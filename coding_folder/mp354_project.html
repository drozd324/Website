                El Niño
            </h2>
            <p>
                This project was made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDeQVaoTvJM" target="_blank">Adriana Voloshyna</a>. <!-- https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast -->

                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni%C3%B1o" target="_blank">El Niño southern oscillation</a> is a weather phenomenon occuring 
                in the pacific ocean which results in unpredictable tempatures, specifically around the east coasts of the Americas and 
                west of Asia, but also has significant effects around the globe. Very quickly, what happens is that due to changes in 
                ocean current velocity and changing temperatures the ocean current changes direction which also results in changing 
                the expected temperatures for us on land. If you would like to know more click 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOi2jFIhZhA" target="_blank">here</a>. A detailed version of our findings is in 
                the following link <a href="https://github.com/drozd324/El-Nino/blob/main/ElNino.pdf" target="_blank">ElNino.pdf</a>.
                Also all the code that made this project on <a href="https://github.com/drozd324/El-Nino" target="_blank">github</a>

                The following are the symplified equations describing this phenomenon where u, T_e and T_w are the only
                properties changing in time t and the rest are constants. You may notice this system is vaguely reminiscent of 
                the <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system" target="_blank">Lorenz equations</a> which they do behave similarly to.
                
                $$\frac{du}{dt} = \frac{B}{\Delta x} (T_e - T_w) - C(u - u^*)$$
                $$\frac{dT_e}{dt} = - \frac{uT_w}{2 \Delta x} - A(T_w - T^*)$$
                $$\frac{dT_w}{dt} = - \frac{uT_e}{2 \Delta x} - A(T_e - T^*)$$

                The following image was definitely not just ripped out of wikipedia so the this page looks a bit nicer.
                There are lots of nice and fun to look at graphs to look at in this pdf
                <a href="https://github.com/drozd324/El-Nino/blob/main/ElNino.pdf" target="_blank">ElNino.pdf</a> also mentioned earlier from which 
                i couldn't be bothered to put up here again.
