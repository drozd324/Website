                Inspired by the unsolvable 3 body problem, I wanted to make a nice visual representation of particles 
                affected by a gravity. This one took me way too long to make, one of the problems was a silly minus sign
                that made everything move away from everything else and the rest goes to incompetence.
                The following shows how to make stuff in the program and which keys do things.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Spacebar -> create 5 random particles 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        G -> fill the screen with particles
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        S -> creates a 'sun' (particle with fixed postion and large mass) at mouse postition
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        X -> reset the program
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Click and Drag mouse -> creates a particle in position of mouse click, then gives the 
                        particle initial velocity proprotional to lenght dragged in direction of dragging
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        L -> toggle lines/trail
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        M -> toggle particles merging
                    </li>
                </ul>

                So I made a little update, I was curious lately about what would happen if I changed the equation
                which determines the force between the two particles and I managed to stumble upon some which have some
                interesting effects. Now if you press the keys 1, 2, 3 or 4, the force the particles will feel will be changed
                as the program is running. The following are the differnt equations for force which i found interesting 
                Each F sub i corresponds to the key pressed.
                $$ { F_1 =\frac{G m_1 m_2}{d^2} } $$
                $$ { F_2 =\frac{G m_1 m_2}{d} } $$
                $$ { F_3 = G m_1 m_2 d } $$
                $$ { F_4 = G m_1 m_2 sin(d) } $$
