                So this is a graphic to show a particle and its path traced out in pygame to show 
                how it would flow in the lorentz attractor. I think it looks pretty neat.
                Since these equations require 3 dimentions, you can press the 1,2 and 3 keys on you keyboard to 
                switch beteen views. These equations were originally created to model convection in the 
                atmosphere and ended up as the poster child of chaos theory. For a read about this 
                topic have a look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" target="_blank">here</a>
