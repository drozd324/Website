				Over the summer of 2024 I had a fun time being an intern at 
				<a href="https://www.iwes.fraunhofer.de/en.html">Fraunhofer IWES</a>
				in Oldenburg Germany and during that time I learned about the the CFD
				sofware of <a href="https://openfoam.org/">OpenFOAM</a>. While trying to
				learn it ins and outs and how to use it, I figured the only option 
				learning it would be to simualte the some fluid flow over a cow, and 
				then make some pictures out of it. So I decided to use the motorbike 
				example as a starting point and	finagled the files around till I got 
				out this <i>magificent</i> image.

			Some details about this	simulation:
			<ul>
				<li> <a href="https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/guide-turbulence.html">RAS kOmegaSST</a>
					model which models some of turbulelnce involved and spits out an everage of
					the quantities. After reaing a bit more this requires some care in the
					meshing of the model which I definitely didnt properly take care of. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Model ripped out from somewhere on thingiverse (cant find the original link).
					Processed it a bit with <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>
					to make it <i>smooth</i> and <i>closed</i>. Then processed it with the 
					OpenFOAM tool snappyHexMesh.

					Visualisation with Paraview
