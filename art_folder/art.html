        This page will be a possibly little gallery of some funny and maybe some actaully pretty stuff i decided to share.
        Note that for some of this stuff that is in 3d model form, was way to easy to add in, its amazing.

        This will contain things i made that i think actually look pretty good. Everything 
        made in <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>. Some other stuff i made is <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/drozd342/designs">here</a>
        on thingiverse.

        <p>
            While you decide what do to with your life, here below is a small art gallery of sorts of some things I made. 
			These are 3d models of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi%E2%80%93Yau_manifold">Calabi-Yao Manifolds</a> which
			have some cool properties in some funky theoretical physics but I just think they look neat, and their mathematical 
			description is "kind of" simple, well, of the ones that are simple that is, hehe.
