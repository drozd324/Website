		There are some true gems here. Good to check out every once in a while to get a giggle from 
		some dumb shit someone did at some point.Also has an excellent picture of a cow with antlers ontop a electric 
		pole, among other things. If an aritcle has some sort of check mark or star, that means that you have found
		 a good one.

		</p>

		<p>
        <a href="https://www.complexity-explorables.org/">This is a lovey website full of wierd simluations.</a>
		.I found<a href="https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/eigenartig/"> this one</a>, very mesmorising.

		<p>
		<a href  ="https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp">W3schools</a> This website is the best way, in my opinion, to learn any
		bit of basics for any programming language that I have attemped to learn. Lots of examples and take as much time as you 
		want, unlike in a youtube video. For learning any librarys, I found youtube videos to be the best.
