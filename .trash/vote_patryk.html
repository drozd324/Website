            why? I think would be a decent candidate to represent you guys as I have experience in both mathematics from my BSc
            and software/programming experience I have gained from internships and being a bit self taught. So I think I should
            be at least ok at seeing everyones perspectives.

            One thing I will try to do is to get some <i><u> computers back into our "computer room"</i></u> (Lloyd 212), since
            they just nuked the whole room and left a bunch of exposed wires dangling about. 
        </p>

            <h3><u>Vote where? </u></h3>
            
            Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (UG and PG):

            Wednesday to Friday â€“ 10am - 5pm in the Hamilton or Arts Block.

            If you are still not convinced, here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hhMUT2U2L4">funny cow song</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            And if that didn't convince you then I will 3d print you the cow below

            <model-viewer src="./art_folder/3dmodels/spherical_cow_blue.glb" alt = "spherical cow" camera-controls auto-rotate>
